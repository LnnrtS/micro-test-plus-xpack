# Tests

There are two tests available, a unit test and a sample.

```bash
xpm run test-all
```

The CI worklow runs all tests.

## Unit test

The `unit-test.cpp` file checks if the framework file counts
the tests results (successes/failures) correctly.

```bash
xpm run test-unit-test
```

## Sample

The `sample-test.cpp` file is a simple example exercising the
few primitives available in the testing framework.

```bash
xpm run test-sample
```
